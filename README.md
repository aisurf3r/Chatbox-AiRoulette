# Chatbox AI Roulette

## Overview

**Chatbox AI Roulette** is an interactive web-based  chat application that allows users to communicate with various AI language models. It provides a seamless interface for sending messages, receiving AI-generated responses, and even highlighting code snippets in the responses for better readability. The project leverages the OpenRouter API to interact with multiple state-of-the-art AI models, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred model for each conversation.
